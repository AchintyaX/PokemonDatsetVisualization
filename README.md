# PokemonDatasetVisaulization
This is data visualization of the pokemon dataset I found, I have used data visualization to find trends in the pokemons 
after conducting some analysis on the dataset it was found that chances of winning of a pokemon over the other are not totally based upon the total stats, 
there fore to study it a prediction system was developed and accuracy was taken in account as the metric
